# Bootstrap Arch Linux

This repository contains a collection of experimental, minimalistic, and modular scripts designed to bootstrap an Arch Linux system. The scripts are organized in a way that allows you to choose exactly what you want to install and configure, providing a high degree of flexibility and control.

## Features

-   **Modular Structure:** Each script is designed to handle a specific task, such as installing a particular set of packages or setting up a specific piece of software. This allows you to pick and choose exactly what you want to install and configure.

-   **User Confirmation:** Before each installation or configuration task, the script will ask for your confirmation. This prevents accidental installations and gives you a chance to review what will be done.

-   **Error Checking:** The scripts check if the necessary files exist and are readable before proceeding, preventing failures during execution.

## Usage

To use these scripts, clone this repository and run the `install.sh` script. This will present you with a menu of options. Select the option that corresponds to the task you want to perform.

Please note that these scripts are experimental and should be used with caution. Always review the scripts before running them to ensure they will not perform any unwanted actions.
